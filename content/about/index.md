Currently I am a back end focus software engineer at Red Ventures. I am working to maintain APIs and microservices written in GoLang, architecting cloud services, and building data pipeline tooling. I love this work and I want to continue to find new challenges working in this space.

My Computer Science, BS, degree came from Clemson University in 2018. If you want to see the resume with descriptions of previous jobs and internships you can check all of that out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchell-mckenzie-533292109/). Some of my side projects, and other websites that I have worked on are up on my [GitHub](https://github.com/mmcken3). These side projects are things like web crawlers, metric collectors/pipelines, tools to help development, and small websites to help keep up with front end frameworks.
